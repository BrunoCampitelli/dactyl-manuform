Notes for functions:

key-position - column row position -> apply-key-geometry?

wall-locate positions object relative to different sections of the wall
wall-locate1-3 - dx dy
1 returns list of dx*wallthickness dy*wall-thickness -1 > just returns
multiple of wall thickness?
2 returns list of dx dy multiples of wall-xy-offset and z offset
3 returns list of dx dy multiple of offset+thickness

wall-xy-offset is where the wall starts sloping
mount-height is keyswitch height + 3 THIS MEANS the "height" of the physical
switch when looked at from above


key-spacing parameters:
extra-height
extra-width

y - openscad 8-11.7= 3.7 real=4
x - openscad 18-20=2 real=3
